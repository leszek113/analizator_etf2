### Configuration

The script automatically detects:

- Port configuration (5005)
- PID and log file locations

### Files Created

- `etf-analyzer.pid` - Process ID file
- `etf-analyzer.log` - Application log file
- `etf-analyzer.lock` - Lock file (if needed)

### Requirements

- Bash shell
- Python 3.11+
- Virtual environment with required packages
- `lsof` command (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
- `curl` command for health checks

### Troubleshooting

#### Port Already in Use
```bash
./scripts/manage-app.sh clean
./scripts/manage-app.sh start
```

#### Application Won't Start
```bash
./scripts/manage-app.sh logs
# Check for error messages in the logs
```

#### Stale PID File
```bash
./scripts/manage-app.sh clean
./scripts/manage-app.sh status
```

### Security Notes

- The script runs with your user permissions
- PID files are stored in the application directory
- Logs may contain sensitive information
- Use in production environments with caution

### Production Use

For production environments, consider:
- Using a proper process manager (systemd, supervisor)
- Implementing log rotation
- Adding monitoring and alerting
- Using environment-specific configurations
